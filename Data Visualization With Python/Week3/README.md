In this module, we will learn about advanced visualization tools such as waffle charts and word clouds and how to create them. We will also learn about seaborn, which is another visualization library, and how to use it to generate attractive regression plots. In addition, we will learn about Folium, which is another visualization library, designed especially for visualizing geospatial data. Finally, we will learn how to use Folium to create maps of different regions of the world and how to superimpose markers on top of a map, and how to create choropleth maps.
