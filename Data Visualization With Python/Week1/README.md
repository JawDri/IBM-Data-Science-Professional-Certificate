In this module, we will learn about data visualization and some of the best practices to keep in mind when creating plots and visuals. We will also learn about the history and the architecture of Matplotlib and learn about basic plotting with Matplotlib. In addition, we will learn about the dataset on immigration to Canada, which will be used extensively throughout the course. Finally, we will briefly learn how to read csv files into a pandas dataframe and process and manipulate the data in the dataframe, and how to generate line plots using Matplotlib.
