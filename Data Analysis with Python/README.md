Learn how to analyze data using Python. This course will take us from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. We will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!

Topics covered:

1) Importing Datasets
2) Cleaning the Data
3) Data frame manipulation
4) Summarizing the Data
5) Building machine learning Regression models
6) Building data pipelines

 Data Analysis with Python will be delivered through lecture, lab, and assignments. It includes following parts:

Data Analysis libraries: will learn to use Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample dataset. We will introduce  pandas, an open-source library, and we will use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. Then we will introduce another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
